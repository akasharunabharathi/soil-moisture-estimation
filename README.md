# visual-soil-moisture-estimator

The project involves data collection on soil moisture content (from a traditional soil moisture measurement probe), temperature data, and images of topsoil to achieve to design new, cost-effective and reliable way(s) of detecting soil moisture to solve the problem of gradual corrosion and dropping reliability that users experience with traditional soil-measurement probes available on the market today.

The approach taken to solving this problem is that we're trying to determine if estimates of soil moisture levels can be reliably gleaned from images of topsoil alone using Computer Vision â€“ by using topsoil images taken at regular intervals and attempting to correlate temporal, ground-truth data from the soil moisture measurement probe and the temperature sensor.

# Hardware Setup

This project uses a Raspberry Pi 4, an Arduino Uno, a DFROBOT Capacitive V1.0 Soil Moisture sensor,
